dclone package versions

Version 0.2-3, August 6, 2009

    * jags.dclone: initsfun argument added.
    * dcsd: for DC SE calculations.
    * ladderplot: simple plotting function.

Version 0.2-2, July 29, 2009

    * dclone.ts: for time series.
    * jags.dclone: update and updatefun added,
      with documantation (still experimental).
    * nobservation.default: can be misleading, thus
      removed.
    * print.mcmc.list: removes attribues before
      printing.
    * plot.dctable: plotting method based on errlines.
    * errlines: draws error bars to existing plot.
    * dctable generic and default method added to
      retrieve dctable attribute from an iteratively
      fitted MCMC object.
    * One parameter cases added to diagnostic functions
      lambdamax.diag and shapiro.diag.
    * Critical values changed.

Version 0.2-1, July 10, 2009

    * DC diagnostics and jags.dclone functions
      added to test for DC convergence.
    * Modified summary for DC mcmc objects added.
    * Behaviour of dclone.default is modified, and
      dclone.list is added for more convenience in
      creating BUGS/JAGS data objects (with arguments
      multiply, unchanged and attrib; credits to GG).
    * jags.fit: model argument can be a function,
      thus no need to call functions to write the
      model file and clean up (as suggested by
      Gabor Grothendieck).
    * dclone is now generic with default behaviour.

Version 0.2-0, June 14, 2009

    * glmexplorer: now step() is used via try().

Version 0.1-3, May 28, 2009

    * mcmc object got n.clones attribute
      if data contained it.
    * nclones.list: returns values for
      objects in a list (for data arg of
      jags.fit).
    * changes in jags.fit to incorporate
      more rjags features (e.g. progress.bar)
    * nclones is now defined as method along
      with a default method.

Version 0.1-2, April 30, 2009

    * print.glmexplorer: new function.
    * glmexplorer: knows step by select arg,
      and has y and model attributes.
    * dclone: handles names and got a
      print method.
    * nclones: new function.
    * mat2list: moved to mefa package.
    * lincovtest: moved from abmi package.

Version 0.1-1, April 23, 2009

    * combine method removed (turned out
      to be nonsense)
    * New parser warnings fixed,
      utf-8 encoding used throughout.
    * Initial documentation done.

Version 0.1-0, April 23, 2009

    * Initial bunch of functions released.
