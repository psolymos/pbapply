dclone package version history

Version 2.0-0, Sept 27, 2013
    * Parallel functions (parJagsModel, parUpdate, parCodaSamples)
      triggered a Note by R CMD check for modifying the global 
      environment. This is now resolved as described below.
    * New function: parDosa (meaning: wolf spider). This
      replaces the snowWrapper. It comes with 2 hidden environments
      (.DcloneEnvModel, .DcloneEnvResults) defined as global variables.
      The .DcloneEnvModel is meant to store temporary objects
      for model fitting, and swiped clean after use.
      The .DcloneEnvResults is meant to store result objects on the 
      workers.
    * These environments come with functions for manipulating them: 
      pullDcloneEnv, pushDcloneEnv, clearDcloneEnv, listDcloneEnv,
      existsDcloneEnv.
    * snowWraper is now deprecated with a warning.
    * R2OpenBUGS added to DESCRIPTION as suggested package.
    * R2WinBUGS::* notation explicitly added to avoid clashes
      with R2OpenBUGS.
    * The program="openbugs" in bugs.fit now calls R2OpenBUGS::bugs
      instead of R2WinBUGS::openbugs. The latter can be
      achieved by program="brugs" and gives a warning the
      "openbugs" via R2WinBUGS is the preferred interface.
      The reason is that as.mcmc.list.bug coercion produces
      slightly different ts attributes under BRugs.
      WinBUGS (via R2WinBUGS) and R2OpenBUGS implementations
      give consistent ts attributes and can be seamlessly coerced
      into mcmc.list object, which is the preferred format for dclone.
    * bugs.parfit: new-old function from extras directory.
      This is for parallel computations. See help file for
      details on suggested best practices.
    * dc.parfit: now allows flavour="bugs" for all partypes options.
    * Removed reference to parallel:::.reg default cluster.
    * SystemRequirements in DESCRIPTION changed to 'one or more of ...'.
    * rjags related functions call requireNamespace("rjags")
      instead of require(rjags).
    * Depends on R 2.15.1 because of the declaration of global
      variables .DcloneEnvModel and .DcloneEnvResults.

Version 1.8-2, March 4, 2013
    * custommodel: splits length 1 character model by '\n'.
      This is the type of model specification that is used
      in STAN related examples.
    * New cloning option added: dctr, allows cloning column-wise.
      This change was motivated by some STAN related data specification
      difficulties.
    * dctable: failed when mcmc.list had 1 parameter.
      This is now fixed by using varnames(x, allow.null=FALSE).

Version 1.8-1, September 3, 2012
    * clusterSplit now checks inheritence of its cl argument in
      R-devel (2.16.0 to be), as a result plotClusterSize
      threw an error when supplying a simple vector to clusterSplit
      (reported by B Ripley), this is now fixed.

Version 1.8-0, July 6, 2012
    * dciid: new function added, it is similar to dcdim.
      dciid attaches an attribute to data frames or matrices
      about columns to be treated as i.i.d. observations
      by dclone(). This aims to facilitates working with the INLA
      package to generate approximate marginals based on DC.
    * dclone.dciid: proper cloning of objects with "dciid"
      tag. It respects possible groupings of observations.

Version 1.7-2, March 21, 2012
    * custommodel and write.jags.model fixed and modified.
      These now accept connection as filename argument.
    * lambdamax.diag and chisq.diag are now generics.
      Methods for mcmc.list is defined.
    * inst/COPYING file removed (standard license).

Version 1.7-1, January 31, 2012
    * Now that rjags is only suggested
      rjags is loaded by snowWrapper if JAGS is used
      (dc.parfit, jags.parfit, parJagsModel).
    * n.chains argument was not passed by dc.parfit
      with partype %in% c("parchains", "balancing").
      Bug is now fixed, thanks to K. Nadeem (UofA).
    * length(cl) >= n.chains is required in
      parJagsModel, parUpdate and parCodaSamples
      recognizes empty workers accordingly.
    * lecuyer module is checked only for clusters
      and not for forking.
    * Rd files cleaned up, documentation is up-to-date.

Version 1.7-0, January 25, 2012
    * Preparing for major CRAN release.

Version 1.6-0, December 19, 2011
    * Depends on parallel and R >= 2.14.0 for multicore type 
      forking on Linux/Unix machines. Heavy lifting is
      still done by showWrapper for easy transitioning.
    * parallel is now a dependency, snow is suggested only.
    * list type declaration of params argument not working
      with partype="both" in dc.parfit. This option is
      defunct at the moment.
    * Windows specific suggested packages removed from dependency
      list due to seamless Linux based testing of 
      forking type parallel features (rsprng, BRugs).
    * cl argument in parallelized functions that
      use snowWrapper can be NULL in which case it 
      takes the value from the mc.cores global option 
      getOption("mc.cores"). If mc.cores is not set (NULL)
      of 1, an error is produced.
    * mclapplySB added to mimic size balancing with forking.
    * parJagsModel, parUpdate and parCodaSamples works
      only with snow clusters.
    * updated.model.mcmc.list.dc: keeps n.clones attribute.
    * evalParallelArgument added for consistent handling
      of parallel arguments.
    * jags.parfit and dc.parfit falls back to sequential
      evaluation if cl is NULL (and default options for 
      parallel processing are unset) or 1.
    * stack method for mcmc.list objects to facilitate
      creating graphics with lattice and ggplot2. 
      Experimental ggplot2 based plotting functions are in 
      dcextras package on R-Forge.
    * The package was extensively tested on Windows XP and 7
      (32 and 64 bit) and Ubuntu Linux 11.10 using
      JAGS, OpenBUGS and WinBUGS (latter only on Windows).
      For testing suite see /devel on R-Forge.

Version 1.5-1, October 18, 2011
    * "[.mcmc.list.dc" addted to extract parts of a fitted object
      and retain its n.clones attribute (no other attributes
      though, e.g. dcdiag, dctable, updated.model).
    * params argument in dc.*fit can take a 2 element
      list. Union of the 2 vectors will be used as
      parameters to monitor (as in jags.fit),
      while the 2nd element of the list is used
      to calculate statistics in dcdiag().
      This way transformations of nodes or
      the deviance monitor won't be used in
      diagnostic tests.

Version 1.5-0, October 17, 2011
    * Major CRAN release with improved parallel features
      (double initialization overhead is removed); 
      with bugfixes from devel versions.
    * The package also has bee extensively tested using 
      Classic BUGS examples (see ChangeLog for dcmle package).

Version 1.4-2, October 16, 2011
    * New function: parallel.inits make use of rjags:::parallelseeds 
      to control RNG settings for initial values in parallel computations.
    * parJagsModel: adapted to initial RNG setup by parallel.inits.
    * jags.parfit: adapted to initial RNG setup by parallel.inits.
    * dc.parfit: adapted to initial RNG setup by parallel.inits
      (partype=both, also partype=parchains via jags.parfit,
      partype=balancing depends on underlying JAGS settings
      as in jags.fit).

Version 1.4-1, September 28, 2011
    * plot.dcdiag: dcdiag colnames from .dcFit were non standard,
      so plot failed to select columns. Now fixed.
    * dc.fit and dc.parfit: got n.chains argument for clean
      handling in parrallel work. (dc.parfit failed with
      partype="both" when n.chains was other than 3.)
    * plotClusterSize: can plot if length(size) < n
      without error/warnings.
    * parLoadModule, parUnloadModule, parListModules,
      parSetFactory, parListFactories: workers returned values as
      expected, but did not actually made changes, bugs fixed,
      allowing full control of JAGS settings on workers.
    * dcdiag and dctable: return NA when subroutines fail
      (gelman.diag, lambdamax.diag, chisq.diag).
      dc.fit and dc.parfit neglects these NA values
      when issuing warning based on Rhat.
    * dcoptions()$overwrite changed to TRUE by default,
      this might spare some headaches when going parallel.
    * lambdamax.diag returned sd instead of variance for
      one parameter case, bug fixed (reported by S Lele).

Version 1.4-0, September 28, 2011
    * Major CRAN release with new parallel features.

Version 1.3-6, September 7, 2011
    * jags.fit return jags model with n.clones
      attribute when n.iter=0.
    * parJagsModel and parCodaSamples: passes the
      n.clones info from data argument.
    * jagsModel and codaSamples added as wrapper
      around jags.model and coda.samples functions of
      rjags package to track dclone information passed
      through data argument and allow custommodel
      specification of model argument (similarly to par* 
      versions of similar functions).
    * .onLoad added to zzz.R

Version 1.3-5, August 23, 2011
    * n.update=1000 is now the default instead of 0
      to ensure independence after adaptation.
      Warning is issued if n.adapt>0 and n.update=0.
    * New argument partype added to dc.parfit,
      possible options (balancing, parchains, both)
      are described on the help page.
    * dc.parfit gained args (update, updatefun, initsfun)
      which are ignored if type is not "parchains".
    * dc.fit and dc.parfit (with "parchains" type)
      now call new internal function .dcFit (former dc.fit reworked
      to allow parallel chains via jags.parfit).
      This function is not exported by namespace, thus
      not user visible and undocumented.
    * dclone is loaded to workers by snowWrapper
      only if .packages() does not contain it yet.
    * dclone method for environmet added: it returns a cloned list.
    * data argument can be environment,
      it is coerced to a list for handling n.clones attribute.
    * jags.fit: quiet argument of jags.model used along with
      verbose dcoption to possibly suppress printout 
      during compilation.
    * Parallel functionality added replicating main rjags functions
      to allow easy updating of jags model objects.
      FUnctions added: parListModules, parLoadModule, parUnloadModule,
      parListFactories, parSetFactory, parJagsModel, parUpdate,
      parCodaSamples, parUpdate; with help pages taken and edited from
      rjags package of M Plummer.
    * .DcloneEnv is created at startup, and removed on unloading 
      dclone. This is intended to store temporary stuff passed
      to workers by snowWrapper.
    * snowWrapper got new argument: unload=FALSE to unload
      packaged from pkg argument.
    * snowWrapper: if name=NULL, .DcloneEnv is used to store
      temporary data.
    * Data cloning compatibile jagsModel and codaSamples
      function added for sequential computations.
      Both functions copied after rjags equivalents,
      jags.model and coda.samples.
    * New method: pairs for mcmc.list objects. It plots
      bivariate kernel density estimates and scatterplots
      in a matrix with univariate densities as diagonal.
    * dctable add object name even if length(n.clones)==1.
    * initsfun handling in dc.parfit partly allowed,
      this new feature is now documented, testing, Example added.
    * All documented S3 methods are now exported by NAMESPACE
      (dependent packages could not import them).

Version 1.3-4, July 9, 2011
    * dc.fit: updating fixed (only updated after 2nd iteration).
    * dc.fit: updatefun and initsfun now accepts 2 arguments,
      1st is model, 2nd is n.clones to allow for cloning
      latent variable vectors on the go. Example reworked accordingly.
    * snowWrapper: cleanup=TRUE cleans up after lib and dir args, too.
    * New option 'overwrite' in dcoptions (used by write.jags.model).
    * packageStartupMessage used in zzz.R .onAttach
    * ... is now passed to snowWrapper in *.parfit (thanks to
      Emmanuel Charpentier for reporting the bug).

Version 1.3-3, May 13, 2011
    * *.parfit: write model to hard drive only if
      cluster type is SOCK (shared memory)
    * snowWrapper: dir=NULL is set as the default.
    * mcmcapply functions simplified, FUN can be missing.
    * jags.parfit help notes that there is no update method
      for parallel mcmc.list objects.
    * snowWrapper got cleanup=TRUE argument to remove
      data after evaluating main function.

Version 1.3-2, March 2, 2011
    * Partial argument match fixed (NOTE from R CMD CHECK).
    * write.jags.model got new argument overwrite=FALSE.
    * Typo in rng.type argument of snowWrapper fixed.
    * plotClusterSize: col arg is reordered according to
      balancing type.

Version 1.3-1, January 4, 2011
    * JASA paper (Lele et al. 2010) citation added to Rd.
    * loading rjags changed: it is now only suggested.
      Reason: some dclone functionality might be useful
      without JAGS/rjags present, and now loading
      rjags won't cause error if JAGS shared library
      not found.
    * glm module not loading at startup because
      it cannot be nicely unloaded in parallel versions.
    * dcoptions RNG got "none" value as default,
      *.parfit functions use dcoptions for snowWrapper.
      As a result, dependencies changed a bit.
    * dc.parfit: none/both balancing fixed (were switched).

Version 1.3-0, December 31, 2010
    * preparing for major CRAN release.
    * final RJ citation added.

Version 1.2-3, December 16, 2010
    * bugs.parfit: migrated into the new dcextras package
      where experimental and not fully supported functions
      will reside in the future.

Version 1.2-2, October 21, 2010
    * expanded examples for *.parfit functions.
    * clusterSeed removed from package: use
      clusterSetupRNG in snow instead.

Version 1.2-1, August 26, 2010
    * experimenting with bugs.parfit:
      the different seeds approach is not satisfactory
      because it cannot garantee independence of the chains
    * seed arg added to bugs.fit
    * RNG option added to work with snowWrapper
    * set.rng arg added to snowWrapper that calls
      snow::clusterSetupRNG
    * options for dclone reworked: can be accessed via
      the dcoptions function, and it sets the dcoptions option
    * dclone.dcdim: dimnames bug fixed when drop=TRUE
    * examples added on inits specifications for *.parfit

Version 1.2-0, August 26, 2010
    * polishing plot methods for R Journal paper.
    * citation entry added.

Version 1.1-1, May 6, 2010
    * print.custommodel has deparse=FALSE argument.
    * glm module for JAGS >2.0 is loaded at startup
    * parallel RNG handling reworked.
    * dctable fix for one parameter mcmc.list.
    * dcdiag returns r.hat for one parameter models.

Version 1.1-0, May 3, 2010
    * dclone was tested with JAGS 2.0.
    * major release submitted to CRAN.

Version 1.0-7, April 7, 2010
    * added flavour argument in dc.parfit.
    * methods for mcmc objects added (coef, vcov, quantile).
    * plot.dcdiag got log.lambda.max option.
    * log.var type of plot.dctable changed.

Version 1.0-6, March 14, 2010
    * openbugs.seed removed.
    * bugs.fit fixed, several arguments removed.
    * dcpar package merged with dclone.
    * WinBUGS/OpenBUGS related revision done:
      as.mcmc.list.bugs and dc.fit now works properly.
    * dclone.ts removed, use dcdim instead.

Version 1.0-5, January 25, 2010
    * drop and perm arguments in dcdim.

Version 1.0-4, January 14, 2010
    * nclones.list: returns 'method' attributes.
    * vcov: got invfisher argument.
    * S3 methods added for diagnostic functions.
    * dclone options restructured.
    * dclone and dcpar split: parallet computing features
      in separate package.
    * dcdiag: diagnostic tools for data cloning.
    * chisq.diag: diagnostic tool added.

Version 1.0-3, December 14, 2009
    * lambdamax.diag: added back.
    * errlines: got col argument.
    * jags.fit: if n.iter=0, the (updated) JAGS model is returned
      instead of an MCMC object.
    * update.mcmc.list: function to perform automatic updates of an
      MCMC object, until a desired statistics value 
      (e.g. R_hat < 1.1) reached.

Version 1.0-2, December 4, 2009
    * updated.model attr in jags.fit output for further updating.
    * bg arg in errlines and box.bg in plot.dctable for background
      color of boxes.

Version 1.0-1, November 19, 2009
    * custommodel function added, fitting functions modified.

Version 1.0-0, November 16, 2009
    * Unload problem fixed (reported by Brian D Ripley).
    * dctable now can take more than one models as arguments.
    * Code annotated, documentation revised.

Version 0.9-0, October 19, 2009
    * First CRAN release with basic functionality.
    * Support for WinBUGS added.
    * Initial functionality is stable.
