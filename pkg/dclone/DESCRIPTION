Description: Low level functions for implementing
    maximum likelihood estimating procedures for 
    complex models using data cloning and Bayesian
    Markov chain Monte Carlo methods with support 
    for JAGS, WinBUGS and OpenBUGS.
    Parallel MCMC computation is supported 
    and can result in considerable speed-up.
